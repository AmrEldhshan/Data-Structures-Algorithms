# Algorithms

Each folder here answers one question: **how does this algorithm actually
work?** The implementations avoid library shortcuts where the point is to learn
the idea.

## How to read an algorithm

1. Read the top comment block: idea, time, space, stability.
2. Identify the **invariant** — what is true before and after each loop or
   recursive call?
3. Trace a tiny input by hand (three to five elements).
4. Run it and compare with your trace.
5. Change one line and predict the effect before running again.

## Testing

The header-only algorithms are covered by `tests/test_algorithms.cpp`:

```bash
cmake --build build --parallel
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

The complete programs are built as `algo_*` targets and can be run directly.
