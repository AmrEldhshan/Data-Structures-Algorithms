# Coverage tracker

This page tracks what exists in the repository and what is still planned. It is
the checklist for the "write everything" goal: the work is split into phases so
each batch can be implemented, built, tested, and documented before the next one
starts.

Legend: `[x]` implemented, `[ ]` planned.
