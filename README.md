# Data Structures & Algorithms — Built From Scratch

> A learning-first C++20 collection of data structures and algorithms. Every
> file explains **how the structure or algorithm is built**, not just how to call
> a library.

[![build-and-test](https://github.com/AmrEldhshan/Data-Structures-Algorithms/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AmrEldhshan/Data-Structures-Algorithms/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This is a study repository, not a production library. The implementations are
written to be read: clear names, small helpers, complexity notes, and comments
that explain the *why*. Many programs also print a trace so you can watch the
algorithm work.

## Why this repository

- **Built from scratch.** Linked lists use raw pointers, heaps use arrays, hash
  tables use hand-written hash functions, and trees implement their own
  rotations.
- **Teaching comments first.** Each file opens with the idea and the
  complexity. Non-obvious lines are explained in place.
- **Runnable examples.** Most topics have a `main()` you can build and run with
  CMake; the header-only algorithms are exercised by the guided tour and the
  test suite.
- **Consistent structure.** One concept per file, `snake_case` names, grouped by
  data structures vs algorithms.
- **Tests for the core.** Sorting and searching are covered by assertions, and
  every header is compiled independently in CI.

## Quick start

Requirements: a C++20 compiler (GCC 11+, Clang 14+, or MSVC 2022) and CMake
3.16+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmrEldhshan/Data-Structures-Algorithms.git
cd Data-Structures-Algorithms

cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --parallel
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure

./build/bin/dsa_demo
```

All example programs are written to `build/bin/`. See
[docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md) for Windows, macOS, single-file builds, and
troubleshooting.

## Learning path

Do not read everything at once. Follow
[docs/LEARNING_PATH.md](docs/LEARNING_PATH.md), which groups the repository into
ten stages:

1. Linear structures (lists, stacks, queues)
2. Hashing
3. Trees
4. Heaps and priority queues
5. Sorting
6. Searching and selection
7. Recursion and dynamic programming
8. Graphs
9. Advanced trees and spatial structures
10. Number theory and NP-complete problems

Each stage includes what to read, what to run, and one exercise that proves you
understood the idea.

## How to study a file

1. Read the top comment block: idea, time, space, and any warning.
2. Find the invariant. For example: "the left subtree contains only smaller
   values" or "`dp[w]` is the best value for capacity `w`".
3. Trace a tiny input by hand (three to five elements).
4. Run the example and compare with your trace.
5. Change one value or one line, predict the result, then run it again.

If an algorithm prints a trace, read the trace *before* looking at the code
again. It usually makes the recursion or the loop obvious.

## Testing and CI

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --parallel
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

The test suite contains:

- `tests/test_algorithms.cpp` — checks that every sort produces a sorted array,
  every search returns the right index, and the recursion examples are correct.
- `tests/test_structures.cpp` — checks the core operations of the linked list,
  stack, queues, BST, AVL, heaps, skip list, and hash table.
- `scripts/check_headers.sh` — compiles every header on its own, which catches
  missing includes and broken include guards.

GitHub Actions runs the build and tests on every push and pull request.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

The most important rule: **do not delete teaching comments**. If you change the
behaviour, update the comment to match it. New topics, extra exercises, and
clearer explanations are all valuable.

The suffix array implementation credits its original student authors in the file
header. Bloom filter, interval, spatial, and NP-complete files also contain
explanations written during coursework; those comments are preserved.
